XML Package Format

This format is currently a work in progress and may not be needed if it is to be replaced by the JSON package format.

The XML collection format is designed to work with the metadata TEI file for an application and provide some additional
pieces of information that are needed by the viewer but will not be in the item's TEI file.  For example 'taggingstatus'
which enables/disables the user tagging capabilities in the user interface.
