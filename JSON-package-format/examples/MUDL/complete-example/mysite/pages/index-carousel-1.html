<p>Many items within the Library’s collections deserve to be
highlighted. This may be because of their historical importance,
uniqueness, beauty, fascinating content, or perhaps their personal
associations. In this special collection within the Cambridge
Digital Library we will draw together books, manuscripts and other
items from across our collections that are especially significant.
Many of them have been displayed in Library exhibitions in the past
– now they can be accessed at any time, from anywhere in the world,
and browsed cover to cover.</p>
