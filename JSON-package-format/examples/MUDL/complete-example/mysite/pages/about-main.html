<h4>Welcome to Manchester Digital Library: A home for the discovery
    of digitised material and research outputs from the University of
    Manchester and beyond.</h4>

<p>The mission of the University of Cambridge is to contribute to
    society through the pursuit of education, learning, and research at
    the highest international levels of excellence.</p>

<p>Cambridge Digital Library supports this mission through a vision
    based on our core values:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Access</b> – We want our unique and distinctive
        collections to be openly accessible to as many people as
        possible.
    </li>

    <li><b>Collaboration</b> – By working together with partners
        across different local, national and international institutions
        we foster a platform for sharing that benefits all and extends
        our combined reach and effectiveness.
    </li>

    <li><b>Engagement</b> – We don’t just want to make our
        collections available, we also want to encourage people to use
        them and help us develop them further.
        them and help us develop them further.
    </li>

    <li><b>Innovation</b> – We want to ensure the long-standing
        legacy of our content remains relevant as technologies evolve so
        that researchers will be able to study it long into the future in
        new and exciting ways.
    </li>

    <li><b>Inspiration</b> – Many of our collections focus on
        inspirational people and themes. We want to inspire a thirst for
        knowledge, understanding and further research.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Story so far</h2>

<p>Over the course of six centuries Cambridge University Library's
    collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one of the
    world's great libraries, with an extraordinary accumulation of
    material. The collections cover every conceivable aspect of human
    endeavour, spanning most of the world's cultural traditions.</p>

<p>The first phase of work on Cambridge Digital Library, which ran
    from 2010 to 2014 was made possible through a lead gift of £1.5m
    from Dr Leonard Polonsky. This generous support has enabled the
    Library to develop its technical infrastructure and create
    significant content, particularly in the areas of faith and science
    - two areas of strength within our unique and distinctive
    collections. It has also enabled us to attract funding from other
    sources, including the AHRC, NSF, NEH, JISC and other private
    donors.</p>

<p>Wherever possible we seek to enhance our digital collections by
    aligning them with scholarly research. Examples of this include not
    only collaborations with research projects based here within
    Cambridge University Library, such as the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/taylor-schechter-genizah-research-unit">Taylor-Schechter
        Genizah Research Unit</a> and the <a target="_blank" class=

        Project</a>, but also those from further afield such as the <a

        "undefined (Link to an external website)" href=
            "http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/">Newton Project</a> and the <a

            "http://www.amnh.org/our-research/darwin-manuscripts-project">Darwin
        Manuscripts Project</a>, which is based at the American Museum of
    Natural History. Our Sanskrit Collection, Spanish Chapbooks
    collection and Board of Longitude collection have all been
    significantly enriched through major AHRC research projects.</p>

<p>Another goal is to make content from the Digital Library freely
    available for use within teaching and research. Copyright and
    licensing will not always permit this, but where it does we are
    providing good quality images, texts and metadata for download and
    reuse. You can even embed our viewer straight into your own
    webpages and blogs.</p>

<p>Given Cambridge’s heritage, we are also acutely aware of the
    need to preserve the work we do for future generations. With
    further funding from the Polonsky Foundation we are currently
    collaborating with Bodleian Libraries in Oxford on a <a target=
