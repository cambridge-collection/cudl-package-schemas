  <h4>April Update</h4>

  <p>This month we are adding a huge variety of material to the
  Digital Library. The first items in our <a href=
  "/collections/aiit/1">Ancient India and Iran Trust collection</a>
  are two sets of photographs of artefacts from Kabul Museum, taken
  by Bridget Allchin in 1951. It is estimated that around 70% of
  the Museum's holdings have since been looted or destroyed, so
  this is an invaluable record of the collection.</p>

  <p>This latest release also sees the completion of the <a href=
  "/collections/rcs/1">Royal Commonwealth Society</a>'s glass plate
  digitisation project. Over the last three years, approximately
  10,000 images have been added to the Digital Library. The release
  of the final 1,000 images exemplifies the collection’s great
  depth and diversity, this time with a particular emphasis upon
  Africa, and dates from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth
  centuries, by which time glass plates were being replaced by more
  practical photographic films. For more details see the <a href=
  "https://specialcollections-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=17410">Special
  Collections blog</a>.</p>

  <p>We continue to expand our College collections, with a further
  four manuscripts from <a href="/collections/stcatharines/1">St
  Catharine's</a> and a fascinating item from Trinity Hall - their
  copy of <a href=
  "/view/MS-TRINITYHALL-THAR-00007-00001-00013/27">The Parker
  Register</a>, a list of the books and manuscripts that were owned
  by Matthew Parker (1504-1575) and passed to the keeping of Corpus
  Christi College, Cambridge.</p>

  <p>Finally, we celebrate the addition of two individual items to
  the Library's collections. The <a href=
  "/view/MS-ADD-10295/1">Jagat Kautuka Kalpavallī</a> is a
  fascinating collection of mathematical and logic problems, in the
  original Sanskrit, with an English translation and striking,
  well-executed illustrations which was acquired with the generous
  support of Art Fund and the Arts Council England. We are also
  adding a <a href="/view/PR-05000-C-00073/9">1516 copy of the
  <i>Decameron</i></a>, with annotations by the Elizabethan spy
  William Herle, which was acquired with a grant from the Friends
  of the National Library's B.H. Breslauer Fund.</p>

  <h4>February Update</h4>

  <p>In collaboration with the Art Research Center at Ritsumeikan
  University we have expanded our <a href=
  "/collections/japanese">Japanese Collection</a> to over 450
  items. There are many rare and visually fascinating examples,
  including some charming and beautiful <a href=
  "/view/PR-01889-00005-00005/1">Japanese fairy tales</a>.</p>

  <p>The Royal Commonwealth Society Collection adds hundreds more
  amazing photographs from all over the globe. A blog post, <a
  href=
  "https://specialcollections-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=17177">Glass
  plates of Oceania, South Asia, the Far East and Africa</a>, is a
  great place to start exploring.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/collections/engineering">Department of
  Engineering‘s annual photo competition</a> highlights the variety
  and beauty of engineering. We’re excited to begin incorporating
  these into Cambridge Digital Library – our first “born digital”
  collection. A glimpse into cutting edge engineering that now sits
  alongside works by Newton and Darwin, whose work was equally
  ground-breaking in its time.</p>

  <p>Finally, the fantastic new collection <a href=
  "/collections/landscapehistories">Landscape histories from the
  air</a> contains around 1,500 images from Cambridge University’s
  Collection of Aerial Photographs (CUCAP). The total collection,
  dating from 1945 to 2009, comprises 497,079 photos that show not
  only our ancient landscapes but also how the UK’s built
  environment underwent radical change in the 20th century and on
  into the 21st.</p>
