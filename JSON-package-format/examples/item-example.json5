    //   (second) with object keys (rather than say "name": "foo") is to
    //   facilitate merging, and for a more terse syntax. It also disallows
    //   repeated identifiers, which avoids a class of errors.
    // - order values replace "seq" integers to specify the order to display
    //   descriptions in. They're strings rather than integers, to allow human
    //   editors to create a somewhat understandable ordering scheme, with named
    //   subsections. e.g. "0.head" comes before "1.body". Also facilitates
    //   merging, as infinite ordering space exists between each key, unlike int
