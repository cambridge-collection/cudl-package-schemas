  <p>This site hosts a major digital corpus of texts of Petrarch
  commentary and exegesis in Renaissance Italy (c.1350 to 1650),
  based on the collections at the John Rylands Library.</p>

  <p>The poet and humanist Francesco Petrarca (1304-74) or Petrarch
  remains to this day one of Italy's most iconic and influential
  vernacular poets. Petrarch's influence on poetic and linguistic
  practice was epoch-defining in Renaissance Europe. His vernacular
  poetry became the supreme model for lyric poetry and indeed for
  refined literary style itself. It spawned countless admirers and
  imitators in England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and
  elsewhere. In Italy, Petrarch's poetry provided the basis upon
  which to establish the standards for developing and regulating
  the Italian language.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">With the rise of Petrarch's reputation
      and influence came the emergence, especially in the late
      fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, of a rich and extensive
      body of critical commentary upon both of his vernacular
      poetic works. In manuscript and increasingly in print, we
      find over twenty major full-length commentaries (many in
      multiple reprints), several hundred items of other exegesis
      such as annotations in editions, public and private lectures
      ('lezioni'), dialogues, and treatises. And yet, quite
      remarkably, especially given Petrarch's influence, diffusion
      and transnational appeal, no attempt has been made to
      catalogue or understand as whole this body of critical
      interpretation. This ambitious collaborative project aims to
      address this neglect and to lay the foundations for all
      future research on the Italian context, and, given Italy's
      formative role in this period, for research on Petrarch's
      afterlife in a variety of other European contexts.</p>

      <p>The project 'Petrarch Commentary and Exegesis in
      Renaissance Italy, c.1350-c.1650â€™ is funded by the AHRC and
      led by Professor Simon Gilson (University of Oxford,
      Principal Investigator), Dr&#160;Federica
      Pich&#160;(University of Leeds, Co-Investigator) and Dr Guyda
      Armstrong (University
      of&#160;Manchester,&#160;Co-Investigator). The team includes
      also two Postdoctoral Fellows, Dr Giacomo Comiati (Oxford)
      and&#160;Dr Lorenzo Sacchini (Leeds) and Julianne Simpson,
      Rare Books and Maps Manager at the University of Manchester
      Library.</p>
